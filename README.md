A very common physical limitation is that keyboards require a separate hardware device in PCs, and make laptops bulky. What if your laptop came with a camera that automatically creates the surface beneath it into a keyboard?
Computer Vision allows us to completely change that. A simple camera can convert any surface into a keyboard. By leveraging computer vision techniques in a Raspberry Pi 4 with Camera module, the system detects and tracks finger movements on a surface, enabling users to type without a physical keyboard. The project integrates image processing algorithms to recognize gestures and translate them into text inputs, providing a novel, touch-free typing solution. This technology has potential applications in accessibility, gaming, and interactive installations.

Parts required
Raspberry Pi 4 model B (2 GB RAM or better)
Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 (Other camera modules should work too!)
SanDisk Extreme 128GB microSD card
