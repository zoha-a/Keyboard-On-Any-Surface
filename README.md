# Keyboard On Any Surface
A very common physical limitation is that keyboards require a separate hardware device in PCs and an integrated one in laptops, which make them bulky. What if your laptop came with a camera that automatically creates the surface beneath it into a keyboard?

Computer Vision allows us to completely change that. By leveraging computer vision techniques in a Raspberry Pi 4 with Camera module, the system detects and tracks finger movements on a surface, enabling users to type without a physical keyboard. The project integrates image processing algorithms to recognize gestures and translate them into text inputs, providing a novel, touch-free typing solution. This technology has potential applications in accessibility, gaming, and interactive installations.

If you run into any problems, or have suggestions for improving the design, assembly, or code to run the camera, please feel free to open an issue.

## Parts required
